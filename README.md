*Common Lisp-inspired macros and functions for use in LFE*

This project is deprecated, as the code it had intended to house has actually been merged into LFE already :-)

We had a series of tickets here for creating LFE implementations of a small subset of Common Lisp functions and macros:
 * https://github.com/lfex/cl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed

all of which were done on an LFE branch once Robert Virding expressed interest in keeping this work in LFE proper.

There is also a related project where something similar will happen, though instead of Common Lisp, it will be Clojure:
 * https://github.com/lfex/clj/
